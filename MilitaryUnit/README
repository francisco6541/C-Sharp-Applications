This little project was one of my assignment while in the MSSA. It was meant to be a small project demonstrating
the use of inheritance and abstraction. I ended up being extra and added a little bit of diaglogue.
It's nothing crazy but if you're reading this, please give it a try. My wife usually isn't into
these little programming projects but loved this one. I think it's pretty funny. Please enjoy!
